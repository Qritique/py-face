        pip install face_recognition
        ```
2. **Run the Script:**
    - Copy the provided Python code into a file, say `sort.py`.
    - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `sort.py`.
    - Run the script after running the face recognition script using Python:

### Disclaimer:
- This script is designed to work on macOS and Linux systems.

### Instructions:
- Run the script and be patient, if you are using VS Code wait for the terminal line bubble (left to the terminal) turns blue, if using normal terminal or other wait till it closes or starts a new line.

- The face recognition program only serves a purpose for this script.
